# What is Developer DAO?

:::info
Developer DAO is a developer owned and governed community.
:::

Welcome to the Developer DAO.

Here you'll find the the links and resources you need to get started. Developer DAO is a oublic good and most of the value we create is free and open to everyone.

If you're not a Member yet, this guide will still be very useful to you and can show you why you should, and how you can, become one.

Lets get things started ...

## About Developer DAO

Developer DAO is a community. A community of builders who share the same mission, values & goals and collectively Govern shared resources in a Treasury to support other Members contributing to realising that mission.

Developer DAO was founded by [Nader Dabit](https://twitter.com/dabit3) on 3rd September 2021 during a [YouTube Live Stream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcOQG4Cpbdk&t=5s). The DAO was an experiment, created by forking the [Loot Project](https://www.lootproject.com/) and changing the metadata from in-game loot items to traits a Developer DAO might hold.

## What does Developer DAO do?

:::info
Developer DAO's [mission](https://snapshot.org/#/devdao.eth/proposal/QmdZQD8h28PiWwwsdJo5mD2DBdC7BvYzrktmbsMoP4AcP6) is to accelerate the education and impact of a new wave of web3 builders.

We've broken this mission down into 4 pillars: Vibe, Learn, Build & Govern:

1. üòé **Vibe**: Twitter Spaces, IRL events, Community Hangouts, Town Halls.

2. üß† **Learn**: Articles, Workshops, Academy Courses, Peer-to-peer Learning.

3. üèóÔ∏è **Build**: Hackathons, Agency Work, Fellowship programs, Jobs.

4. üë©üèΩ‚Äç‚öñÔ∏è **Govern**: Propose, debate and vote on ideas and budget allocations.

The vast majority of the value the DAO creates is provided as public goods. That means, Members and non-members are like have equal access and one persons use doesn't impact anothers.
