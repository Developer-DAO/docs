## About Developer DAO

Developer DAO is a community. A community of builders who share the same mission, values & goals and collectively Govern shared resources in a Treasury to support other Members contributing to realising that mission.

Developer DAO was founded by [Nader Dabit](https://twitter.com/dabit3) on 3rd September 2021 during a [YouTube Live Stream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcOQG4Cpbdk&t=5s). The DAO was an experiment, created by forking the [Loot Project](https://www.lootproject.com/) and changing the metadata from in-game loot items to traits a Developer DAO might hold.
