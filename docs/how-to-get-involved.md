# How to get involved

The vast majority of the value and opportunity Developer DAO creates is provided in the open and free as public goods.

That means most of the value for you is available outside of discord via Twitter, YouTube, Substack and our Blog.

## Connect with us

The best way to take advantage of the opportunity provided is to connect with us there:

1. Follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/developer_dao).
2. Sign-up for [workshops and event notifications](https://lu.ma/developer-dao).
3. Subscribe to our [newsletter](https://developerdao.substack.com/).
4. Join our [Job Board](https://developerdao.pallet.com/jobs).

By connecting with us here you'll be notified of all the awesome opportunities for learning and building, as well as the amazing things others in the community are doing.

## Access to Discord

Discord access is currently gated to Members who hold over 400 CODE tokens or anyone who holds the original D4R NFT.

Access to discord means vibes, networking, peer to peer learning, gated events, contributing to the DAO via Sub-DAOs and much more. There are many folks who attest to the community activing as a great place to make friends and a launch pad for their career.

If you want to join the discord, the easiest way is to purchase the NFT on either [Opensea](https://opensea.io/collection/devs-for-revolution) and [LooksRare](https://looksrare.org/collections/0x25ed58c027921E14D86380eA2646E3a1B5C55A8b?queryID=59b7ab0de32710bb2a3a8d6db055e10d).

NB the NFT does not give you voting rights on Snapshot - all governance sits with the CODE token.

If you don't hold either of these just don't fret. You can get involved in hackathons, events, workshops and more.

## Get Stuck in

Once you're connected feel free to search through our Blog for helpful content, our YouTube workshop playlist for deep dives and tutorials or keep an eye on on Twitter for announcements of new Hackathons, workshops and events.
