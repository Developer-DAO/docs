# How to get involved

As mention in [About D_D], the vast majority of the value and opportunity Developer DAO creates is provided in the open and free as public goods.

That value is mostly delivered outside of discord via Twitter, YouTube, Substack and our Blog.

## Connect with us

The best way to take advantage of the opportunity provided is to connect with us there:

1. Follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/developer_dao).
2. Sign-up for [workshops and event notifications](https://lu.ma/developer-dao).
3. Subscribe to our [newsletter](https://developerdao.substack.com/).
4. Join our [Job Board](https://developerdao.pallet.com/jobs).

By connecting with us here you'll be notified of all the awesome opportunities for learning and building, as well as the amazing things others in the community are doing.

Once you've done that, check out our opportunites to Vibe, Learn, Build and Ship.

## Access to Discord

:::tip
The DAO is not Discord. You can access most of what we do for free outside of Discord.
:::

Discord access is currently gated to Members who hold over 400 CODE tokens or anyone who holds the original D4R NFT. If you don't hold either of these just don't free, check out How to Become a Member.

## Get Stuck in

Once you're connected feel free to search through our Blog for helpful content, our YouTube workshop playlist for deep dives and tutorials or keep an eye on on Twitter for announcements of new Hackathons.
