# How to get involved

As mentioned, the vast majority of the value and opportunity Developer DAO creates is provided in the open and free as public goods.

That means most of the value for you is available outside of discord via Twitter, YouTube, Substack and our Blog.

## Connect with us

The best way to get involved is to connect with the community:

1. Follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/developer_dao).
2. Sign-up for [workshops and event notifications](https://lu.ma/developer-dao).
3. Subscribe to our [newsletter](https://developerdao.substack.com/).
4. Join our [Job Board](https://developerdao.pallet.com/jobs).

Once you've done that, check out our opportunities to Vibe, Learn, Build and Ship.

## Access to Discord

:::tip
The DAO is not Discord. You can access most of what we do for free outside of Discord.
:::

Discord access is currently gated to members who hold over 400 CODE tokens or anyone who holds the original D4R NFT. If you don't hold either of these, you can check out [how to become a member](/getting-started/become-a-member).
