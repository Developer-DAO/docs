# About D_D

Developer DAO is a community first. A Social DAO that has brought together 1000s of new and existing builders in the ecosystem to _build web3 with frens_.

[Nader Dabit](https://twitter.com/dabit3) founded Developer DAO on a [YouTube Live Stream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcOQG4Cpbdk&t=5s) on 3rd September 2021. They launched the DAO as an experiment by forking the [Loot Project](https://www.lootproject.com/) and changing the metadata from in-game loot items to traits a Developer DAO might hold.

## Misson, Values & Goals

Our first ever Governance was to [Ratify our mission, values and goals](https://snapshot.org/#/devdao.eth/proposal/QmdZQD8h28PiWwwsdJo5mD2DBdC7BvYzrktmbsMoP4AcP6).

### Mission

Developer DAO exists to accelerate the education and impact of a new wave of web3 builders.

### Values

#### Transparency

Open source everything, conversations in public, document and share the journey

### Goals

## Membership vs Access

Membership means the ability to vote in Governance on Snapshot.

Access on the otherhand is variable depending on what you seek to access. Discord, for example, requires holding at least 400 CODE tokens or our D4R NFT.

That said, most of the opportunities we create to Vibe, Learn and Build are open to everyone as a public good.
