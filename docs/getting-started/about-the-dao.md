## About Developer DAO

Developer DAO is a community of builders who share the same mission, values & goals. We collectively govern shared resources in a [treasury](https://boardroom.io/devdao/treasuryOverview) to support and enable our mission.

Developer DAO was founded by [Nader Dabit](https://twitter.com/dabit3) on 3rd September 2021 during a [YouTube Live Stream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcOQG4Cpbdk&t=5s). The DAO was an experiment, created by forking the [Loot Project](https://www.lootproject.com/) and changing the metadata from in-game loot items to traits a Developer DAO might hold.

## What does Developer DAO do?

:::info
Developer DAO's [mission](https://snapshot.org/#/devdao.eth/proposal/QmdZQD8h28PiWwwsdJo5mD2DBdC7BvYzrktmbsMoP4AcP6) is to accelerate the education and impact of a new wave of web3 builders.

We've broken this mission down into 4 pillars: Vibe, Learn, Build & Govern:

1. üòé **Vibe**: Twitter Spaces, IRL events, Community Hangouts, Town Halls.

2. üß† **Learn**: Articles, Workshops, Academy Courses, Peer-to-peer Learning.

3. üèóÔ∏è **Build**: Hackathons, Agency Work, Fellowship programs, Jobs.

4. üë©üèΩ‚Äç‚öñÔ∏è **Govern**: Propose, debate, vote on ideas and budget allocations.

The vast majority of the value the DAO creates is provided as public goods. This means that the value is available to everyone, regardless of whether they are a member or not. For example, a workshop is a public good.
