# What is a Developer DAO

Developer DAO is a builder owned and governance community.

A social space for builders, built by builders to help other all builders become better builders and build more cool projects.

### Our missions

Developer DAO exists to accelrate the educationa and impact of a new wave of web3 builders.

_Established in our first Snapshot Proposal - [Ratify our mission, values and goals](https://snapshot.org/#/devdao.eth/proposal/QmdZQD8h28PiWwwsdJo5mD2DBdC7BvYzrktmbsMoP4AcP6)_

### Our values

#### Transparency

Open source everything, conversations in public, document and share the journey

## Membership vs Access

Membership means the ability to vote in Governance on Snapshot.

Access on the otherhand is variable depending on what you seek to access. Discord, for example, requires holding at least 400 CODE tokens or our D4R NFT.

That said, most of the opportunities we create to Vibe, Learn and Build are open to everyone as a public good.
