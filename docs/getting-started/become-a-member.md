# How to become a Member?

A Member is anyone that holds at least 1 CODE token.

The main benefit of being a Members is so you can help Govern the DAO. This means participating in the DAO's Governance process to help shape it's future and how we allocate our shared resources.

## How do I get the CODE token?

### Purchase

### Earn

### Scholarship

Access, on the otherhand, is variable depending on what you seek access to. The learning materials, workshops, events and hackathons we promote are mostly free to all as a public good (as they should be!). Certain other things, such as discord and voting require holding the $CODE token or NFT.
