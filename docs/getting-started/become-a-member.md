# How to become a member?

A member is anyone that holds at least 1 CODE token.

The main benefit of being a member is so you can help Govern the DAO. This means participating in the DAO's Governance process to help shape it's future and how we allocate our shared resources.

:::tip
If you don't hold the $CODE token don't worry, most of the DAO's value is open and free as a public good. Check out [How to get involved](/getting-started/how-to-get-involved).

## How do I get the CODE token?
