# How to become a Member?

A Member is anyone that holds at least 1 CODE token.

The main benefit of being a Member is that you can help Govern the DAO. This means participating in the DAO's Governance process to help shape its future and how we allocate our shared resources.

:::tip
If you don't hold the $CODE token don't worry, most of the DAO's value is open and free as a public good. Check out [How to get involved](/getting-started/how-to-get-involved).
